# EHealth
It is an online booking management system where hospitals, clinics, or individual doctors can create an account and accept bookings, while users can view available health services near them and create bookings.

There is also a calendar management system where users can see the available slots of the doctors and create bookings as per their convenience, and the doctor calendar will be automatically blocked based on their individual bookings. Also, doctors can sync their Google/Outlook calendar events to block specific timings on their calendar.
